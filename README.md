## What is PCAT
PCAT stands for PDX for Childhood cAncer Therapeutics. It is a unique resource cataloguing childhood cancer PDXs. As of June 2024, PCAT deposits data for 324 PDX models, ranging from leukemia to very rare tumors such as Ewing sarcoma. PCAT integrated data from TARGET, an NCI-funded multi-institutional collaborative project to profile a large number of childhood cancer patients (https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target). We spent tremendous effort on sorting out this high-dimensional dataset and plug it into each module so it is side-by-side with the PDX dataset.
